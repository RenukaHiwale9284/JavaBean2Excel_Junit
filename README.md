# Bean 2 xls / Excel (Java Beans to Excel files Exporter / Converter)

Converts Java Beans to Excel files (xlxs) via Apache POI including cellformats


I got a little bit annoyed by the Primefaces datatable exporter (p:dataexporter), because it's just formating
every cell in String (which can cause problems with functions in Excel) and doesn't support files with more than 65,536 rows - So I decided to write my own exporter.

I use Apache POI - the Java API for Microsoft Documents (http://poi.apache.org/)

**Fileformat:**
The default Excel 2007 and later workbook format. 
In reality a ZIP compressed archive with a directory structure of XML text documents. Functions as the primary replacement for the former binary .xls format, although it does not support Excel macros for security reasons.

## Features

 - Formats every cell with cell dataformat like money, decimal etc
 - CellTypes
 - "New" Excel Format
 - Simple setup via BeanColumn - class:
 
 BeanColumn[] columns = new BeanColumn[] {
				new BeanColumn("name", "Carmodel", FormatType.TEXT),
				new BeanColumn("power", "Power", FormatType.INTEGER),
				new BeanColumn("priceinEuro", "Price in Euro", FormatType.MONEY) };
                
This simple setup transforms the attribute name to Text in Excel, priceinEuro to MONEY ("#,##0.00\\ â‚¬" = Euro) and so on.
            
    

## TODO
Implement more cell formats like percent, Date, text with wrap (+width) etc.
